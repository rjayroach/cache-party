=begin
The FacebookUser is totally dependent upon McpAuth for the facebook_id
While this is DRY, it is highly coupled, resulting in the following drawbacks:
- cannot be tested in isolation of the Auth gem
- an FB user can never be cached without a user record also being created...
- just bogus...
- the facebook id is -the single- identifying link to FB so if it's not here then not real useful
